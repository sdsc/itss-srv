Language(s) Used: Javascript, PHP, MySQL

Description
=============================

The SDSC Cost Estimate Tool is to be used on the SDSC services page. The user is able to enter their desired services and additional features, and the tool will automatically calculate the costs. User has the option of choosing either a standard or a high security VM slice, and then they are given the option to choose an operating system. In addition to prices, users are able to see the System Management options as well as the manager for their chosen VM. There is error checking to make sure numbers are within range. 

About this Version
=============================

v1.0 of the SDSC Cost Estimate Tool only utilizes Javascript. It definitely does not use OOP to the fullest (sorry), but it is functional. Subtotals and totals are calculated and updated instantly.

Future plans for this project: use PHP instead and integrate with MySQL so that maintenance and adding of services is a lot easier in the future. PHP needed to email the information to a designated email.

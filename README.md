Description
=============================

The SDSC Cost Estimate Tool is to be used on the SDSC services page. The user is able to enter their desired services and additional features, and the tool will automatically calculate the costs. Afterwards, users are able to save the quote in PDF format. This is done by utilizing jsPDF and html2canvas. 

About this Version
=============================

v1.2 of the SDSC Cost Estimate Tool utilizes Javascript and minimal PHP/MySQL. It definitely does not use OOP to the fullest (sorry), but it is functional. Subtotals and totals are calculated and updated instantly with some primitive validation. It has the ability to generate PDF files from the dynamically created tables, which is good.
